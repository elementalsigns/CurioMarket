When you see a message saying "subscription required" even though you've already signed up, it usually means your account is not being correctly identified as a paying user by the service you are trying to access. 
Here are the most common reasons this occurs and how to troubleshoot the problem:
Your payment failed or is pending
The most frequent cause is a failed or incomplete payment for your subscription.
What happens: If a recurring payment fails (e.g., due to an expired card or insufficient funds), Stripe sets the subscription status to past_due or incomplete. The system then restricts access until a successful payment is made.
How to fix it:
Check for an email or in-app notification from the service, which may prompt you to update your payment information.
Sign in to your account and look for a billing or subscriptions page to see if your payment status is "past due" or "incomplete".
Update your payment method to trigger a new payment attempt. 
The website is failing to recognize your account
This is a technical issue where the website's database is not properly synchronized with Stripe.
What happens: The site's own database may not have recorded your active subscription, or it may have failed to associate your user ID with the correct Stripe customer ID. This can happen if there was an error during the initial sign-up process.
How to fix it:
Sign out and sign back in. This is often enough to force the system to check your account status again.
Clear your browser's cache and cookies. This ensures you're not seeing old, stored information and that a fresh login is attempted.
Contact the service's support team. Explain the situation and provide your account email. The support team can manually verify your subscription status on their end. 
You are signed in with the wrong account
If you have used the same email for multiple services or accidentally created a duplicate account, you may be signed into the wrong one.
What happens: The account you are currently logged into has no active subscription, while your payment is tied to a different account.
How to fix it:
Check your email for receipts from Stripe to see which email address is listed.
If you find a different email, sign out of the current account and sign back in using the email associated with your payment. 
The subscription is paused or canceled
What happens: A subscription can be paused temporarily (for instance, to stop billing during a break) or canceled entirely. In these cases, access would be revoked as your billing is no longer active.
How to fix it:
Log in and visit your account's subscription or billing page.
If the subscription is paused, you should see an option to resume it.
If it was canceled, you may need to re-subscribe to regain access. 
The issue is on the service's side
In some rare cases, the issue may be a bug with the service's integration with Stripe.
What happens: A problem with the API connection prevents your account from properly receiving access rights.
How to fix it:
If you have gone through the other steps and the problem persists, contact the service's customer support.
They can investigate the connection between their system and Stripe to resolve the error.
