The blood vial for this piece, comes empty and the kit contains a full set of medical supplies which you can use to draw a few drops of blood from yourself or perhaps a lover, friend, partner or anyone else that you wish to draw closer to.\n\n \n\nThe kit also contains medical grade anticoagulant which is used to keep that blood from clotting once inside the glass vial.\n\n \n\nTo carry your lover’s blood is said to create a bond between two souls. It is said to represent the ultimate sacrifice of your own life force, thus said to represent the deepest of trust and love.To carry your own blood is said to be a symbol of yourself and ancestry. It is said to represent the deep codes, in which you choose to live, die and live again. There are so many beliefs regarding the subject of blood and the magic it contains, that you should take the time to consider what it means to you personally which gives it an even stronger energy and power.\n\n \n\nPlease Read Before Ordering!\n\n \n\nThis piece is completely unique, packaged at Artem Mortis with instructions on how to hygienically draw the blood needed to place in the vial. While I provide medical grade anticoagulant, I cannot guarantee that your blood will not coagulate over time and if the anticoagulant is not applied to the blood soon enough. Typically as long as the anticoagulant and blood meet with a minute of drawing the blood, you shouldn’t have any problems, please feel free to let me know if you have any questions or problems.\n\n \n\n \n\nYour Blood Vial Pendant Necklace Kit Includes:\n\n\nYour kit includes:\n\n \n\n• Two hand-blown glass vials (including the cap).\n\nVials are complete with rubber stoppers,\n\n• Metal pendants 1-3/4\" long,\n\n• Two metal ball chains 24” long.\n\n• Two portions of anticoagulan\n\nt• Two full sets of supplies, to assist in your process\n\n• One small tube of super glue\n\n \n\n \n\n***Buy purchasing this kit you agree to the following terms***\n\n \n\n1.
