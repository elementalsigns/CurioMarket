There are so many beliefs regarding the subject of blood and the magic it contains, that you should take the time to consider what it means to you personally which gives it an even stronger energy and power.\n\n \n\nPlease Read Before Ordering!\n\n \n\nThis piece is completely unique, packaged at Artem Mortis with instructions on how to hygienically draw the blood needed to place in the vial. While I provide medical grade anticoagulant, I cannot guarantee that your blood will not coagulate over time and if the anticoagulant is not applied to the blood soon enough.
