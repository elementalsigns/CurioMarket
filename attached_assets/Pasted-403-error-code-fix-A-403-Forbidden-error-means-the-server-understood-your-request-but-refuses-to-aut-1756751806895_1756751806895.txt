403 error code fix
A 403 Forbidden error means the server understood your request but refuses to authorize it, so you are denied access. The cause can be a server-side misconfiguration or a client-side issue, such as an incorrect URL or a VPN blocking your access. 
For general web browsing
If you encounter a 403 error while visiting a website, try these common fixes: 
Clear your browser's cache and cookies. Your browser's cached files may be outdated and conflicting with the server.
Check the URL. Make sure you are using the correct web address and that there are no typos.
Disable your VPN or proxy. A website might block access from certain VPN or proxy IP addresses for security or regional reasons.
Temporarily disable browser extensions. A misbehaving extension could be causing a conflict that blocks access to the site.
Scan for malware. In rare cases, malware can interfere with your requests and trigger this error.
Try a different browser or device. Accessing the page from a private or incognito window, a different browser, or another device can help you determine if the problem is specific to your current setup.
Wait and try again. The error may be temporary. Give it some time before trying to access the page again. 
For website administrators
If you are the website owner, the problem is likely a server-side issue. You will need to investigate your website's files and server configuration.
Check file and directory permissions. This is one of the most common causes of 403 errors. Files often need to be set to 644 and directories to 755.
WordPress users: Use an FTP client or your hosting provider's file manager to reset file and folder permissions.
Restore a corrupted .htaccess file. A misconfigured or corrupted .htaccess file can cause a 403 error. Back up and then delete the old file to see if access is restored. If it is, regenerate a new .htaccess file.
Disable and test plugins (for WordPress). A faulty or incompatible plugin can cause the error. Disable your plugins one by one to see which one is causing the issue.
Upload an index page. A 403 error can happen if a user tries to access a directory without an index.html or index.php page. Place an index page in the directory to fix this.
Review your firewall settings. A security plugin or firewall (like ModSecurity) can mistakenly block legitimate requests.
Contact your hosting provider. If you can't resolve the issue, your host can check for server-side misconfigurations, blacklisted IPs, or other potential problems.
