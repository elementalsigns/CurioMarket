                "bio": "When we first set out on this strange and beautiful path in 2014 we began as The Witch in the Woods on Etsy, a guiding presence in the realm of Oddities & Curiosities. Today, that spirit still lingers under the name Artem Mortis. (Latin for The Art of Death) From those roots, weâ€™ve grown into something larger, with a more diverse collection and a home all our own: a thriving online oddity shop where the shadows and the light entwine.\n\nAt Artem Mortis, death is not an ending, but a transformation an alchemy that turns silence into song, endings into beginnings. Through this truth, we craft art that is at once beautiful and unsettling, luminous and dark.\n\nI am endlessly drawn to the magic that stirs in the delicate balance between shadow and brilliance, the hushed corners where mystery dwells and the sudden spark that reveals hidden truths. It is in this dance of opposites that inspiration is born. Each creation you find here is an offering of that enchantment: a reflection of fragility and strength, of beauty found in both the veil of night and the glimmer of dawn.",
