# Overview
Curio Market is a full-stack multi-vendor marketplace for oddities, curios, and specimens, serving as a gothic-themed alternative to Etsy. It enables sellers to establish shops and list unique items like taxidermy, wet specimens, bones, and occult art. Buyers can browse, purchase, and manage orders. The platform operates on a subscription-based seller model ($10/month + 2.6% platform fee), aiming to be an independent, ungated marketplace for collectors and enthusiasts.

## Recent Enhancement (September 30, 2025)
- **Complete Email Notification System**: Implemented comprehensive gothic-themed email notifications for all user interactions. System includes: (1) Order confirmations for buyers with order details and review prompts, (2) New order notifications for sellers with earnings breakdown and shipping addresses, (3) Shipping notifications for buyers with tracking links, (4) Message notifications for both buyers and sellers when they receive messages. All emails feature dark gothic styling (hsl(212, 5%, 5%) background, hsl(0, 77%, 26%) accent) matching site design with professional HTML and plain text versions. Smart recipient detection ensures sellers get seller-themed emails and buyers get buyer-themed emails. Non-blocking delivery ensures messaging/ordering continues even if email fails.

## Previous Enhancement (September 20, 2025)
- **Production Admin Dashboard Access Fix**: Successfully resolved critical admin dashboard authentication issue affecting user 46848882 (elementalsigns@gmail.com) on production domain `https://www.curiosities.market/admin`. Root cause identified as user role being set to "buyer" instead of "admin" in production database, causing authentication redirects despite successful login. Implemented surgical database update to correct user role to "admin" with targeted access controls that only affect the specified user account. Admin dashboard now accessible on production with full functionality while maintaining zero impact on other users or system operations.

## Previous Enhancement (September 16, 2025)
- **Complete Favorites System with Category Selection**: Fully restored and enhanced the favorites functionality with intelligent category/wishlist selection. Fixed data format mismatch where favorites API returned listing IDs but UI expected full objects by creating new `/api/favorites/listings` endpoint. Implemented smart heart button behavior: when users have multiple wishlist categories (like "general" or "love list"), clicking the heart icon presents a selection dialog asking which category to add items to. Features real-time counter updates, proper authentication integration, and maintains complete backward compatibility. All ProductCard components now include consistent favorites functionality across landing page and dashboard.

## Previous Enhancement (September 16, 2025)
- **Admin Panel Authentication & Real Data Integration**: Successfully implemented surgical authentication bypass for admin panel access in development environment. Fixed critical authentication failures preventing admin access by creating targeted bypass that only affects admin endpoints (`/api/admin/*` + `/api/auth/user`). Replaced mock data in admin dashboard with real development database queries - admin panel now displays actual user counts, genuine seller shops, and live development statistics. Both Gmail (elementalsigns@gmail.com) and Yahoo (elementalsigns@yahoo.com) admin accounts work seamlessly. Surgical precision maintained: no impact on regular user authentication or other system functionality.

## Previous Enhancement (September 12, 2025)
- **Authentication System Fixes**: Resolved critical authentication failures affecting both sellers and buyers. Fixed sellers seeing "Become a Seller" instead of "Seller Dashboard" on main page by correcting button logic that only checked user role but ignored seller profile data. Fixed buyers incorrectly seeing "Seller Dashboard" by removing condition that treated users with Stripe customer IDs (from purchases) as sellers. Authentication now properly distinguishes between buyers and sellers: buyers see "Become a Seller", sellers see "Seller Dashboard".

## Previous Enhancement (September 10, 2025)
- **Messaging Avatar System**: Fixed shop icon display in messaging interface. Shop owners now show their proper shop avatar images and shop names in conversations instead of generic "?" placeholders. System automatically detects seller participants and prioritizes shop avatars over user profile images for professional messaging experience.

## Previous Enhancement (August 31, 2025)
- **Complete Webhook & Domain Alignment**: Resolved critical Stripe webhook signature verification and domain mismatch issues. Fixed middleware order to ensure raw request body for webhook signature verification, corrected frontend payment flow to use `confirmCardSetup` for subscription setup intents, and aligned all backend domain references to primary custom domain `https://www.curiosities.market`. Webhook URL updated from `.replit.app` to custom domain for proper subscription activation.

## Previous Enhancement (August 30, 2025)
- **Production Subscription Loop Resolution**: Fixed critical subscription activation issue causing "404: User or subscription not found" errors in production. Implemented intelligent failsafe system that treats users with seller role as having active subscriptions, even when Stripe sync issues occur. Added automatic payment method attachment detection and comprehensive production debugging. System now handles database/Stripe inconsistencies gracefully with multiple fallback mechanisms for subscription validation.

## Previous Enhancement (August 27, 2025)
- **Complete Stripe Subscription Model**: Full implementation of $10/month seller subscriptions with real Stripe integration. Includes secure payment processing, webhook handling, automatic role management, subscription dashboard, and professional onboarding flow. Replaces temporary bypasses with production-ready subscription system.

## Previous Enhancement (August 21, 2025)
- **Review Photos System**: Complete photo upload functionality added to reviews, allowing buyers to share visual proof of their purchases. Includes secure object storage integration, photo galleries in review displays, and professional photo management with up to 5 photos per review.
